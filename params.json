{"name":"Dashboard","tagline":"The offline project managing tool.","body":"![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/gCrYW9i.png)\r\n\r\nDashboard is an easy-to-setup and easy-to-use lightweight nodejs & meteor project management app.\r\n\r\n### Why \r\nDashboard came from my need for a twitter-based to-do managing app. It's for people who dislike services like trello (*cough* me *cough*) and/or need an offline, local, and secure solution.\r\n\r\n1. Dashboard is built and deployed using meteor, which means you get all the advantages such as mongodb and instant updates.\r\n\r\n2. Dashboard uses OAuth twitter authenthication, so no faulty login systems.\r\n\r\n3. Dashboard is built with bootstrap, and mobile compatible.\r\n\r\n### Setting Up\r\n\r\nOpen up your favorite bash-compatible terminal and write : \r\n\r\n\twget https://rawgit.com/sqrdcat/sh/d/in.sh && bash in.sh\r\n\r\nWhat this does is download and run the installer script for dashboard. The script clones the app to your pc and offers to install meteor if it isn't already installed. Keep in mind that this requires that you have git installed.\r\n\r\nIf you DON'T have git nor want to install git, click the download button, extract the folder and execute ./run.sh in it.\r\n\r\nRun.sh is a short script which runs dashboard in the background for you. The script itself doesn't do anything unless you pass a paramater to it. \r\n\r\nFor example : \"./run.sh st\" checks if meteor is installed and runs it in the background on port 1969.\r\nHere's the whole list of arguments :\r\n\r\n\tst -\tstarts the server in background, with the logs being outputted to out.txt\r\n\tdb  -\tstarts server without nohup, printing the output to the console.\r\n\tcpt 4949 -\tstarts the server with the custom port 4949 (starts in background)\r\n\tcpd 4949 -\tstarts the server with the custom port 4949, printing the logs directly to the console.\r\n\r\n### Mandatory Configuration\r\n\r\nUnless you want to keep the default project details, then edit PROJECT.JS in /public. If you happen to mess up here's a default config :\r\n\r\n\r\n\tprojecttitle = \"One File Application\";\r\n\tprojectdesc = \"A really fine application.\";\r\n\tprojectver = \"1.0.0\"; \r\n\tprojectweb = \"http://example.com\";\r\n\r\nAlso please note you might have to reconfigure the twitter login from the frontend with the \"configure twitter login\" button.\r\n\r\n### Deploying your app for remote access\r\n\r\nThere are several methods to do this. \r\n\r\nThe first one of course imiplies using the default meteor deploy servers. To do this, use the \"meteor deploy\" command.\r\n\r\nAnother way of doing it is running a server on your local network / on your own computer and using a vpn such as hamachi or port forwarding to your own IP address.\r\n\r\nThe third one is using a hosting service. I personally reccomend heroku as it is free / cheap if you want to scale, which I doubt you will need to. Some heroku guides can be found here :   https://devcenter.heroku.com/start   and here :    https://github.com/jordansissel/heroku-buildpack-meteor/blob/master/README.md\r\n\r\n### Meteor & Windows, and explaining run.sh\r\n\r\nRun.sh is simply a convienent script for passing meteor commands.\r\nFor example, ./run.sh st simply checks for a meteor install and runs nohup meteor run -p=1969\r\n\r\nNow for the trickier part, using dashboard on windows. Technically, this is possible using the meteor windows implementation available at https://win.meteor.com/ .\r\n\r\nHowever keep in mind I am unable to test it and will merely provide you with commands and how to set it up.\r\n\r\n1. Install meteor using the windows installer, then download dashboard.\r\n\r\n2. Use this guide to open cmd in the dashboard directory : http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/how-open-windows-command-prompt-any-folder.htm\r\n\r\n3. For running the server, run the following command : \r\n\r\nmeteor --production -p=1969\r\n\r\n\r\nI remind you that this might NOT work, but I am trying to test this soon enough.\r\n\r\n### Fin.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to meet bugs please open an issue / message me on twitter at http://twitter.com/sqrdcat","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
